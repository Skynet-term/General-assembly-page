Upon completing the first part of the General Assembly non technical DASH assignment. I decided to make it more creative to showcase my knowledge so far.
Instead of creating individual parts of the assessments within the DASH website itself I decided to just create my own webpage, BLOG, Business site, and Robot.
All will be linked within the same webpage created on netlify to each other from a navigation bar that I created on the first webpage.
The remaining webpages should have an image of me in the header with a background only in the header. Also a navigation with links to the other sections.
The bottom portion of the page will be the projects.
Dont add a bottom navigation at this time unless specified by the projects.
